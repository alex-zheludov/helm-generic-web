# Generic Helm Chart for Web Applications

This repository hosts a Helm chart designed for deploying generic web applications in Kubernetes. It's tailored to provide a flexible and robust deployment strategy, covering key Kubernetes resources like Deployments, Services, Ingress, and Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA).

## Chart Overview

The Helm chart in this repository includes the following configurations:

- **Deployment**: Manages the deployment of the web application, ensuring desired replicas and update strategies.
- **Service**: Exposes the web application within the Kubernetes cluster or to external traffic.
- **Ingress**: Configures external access to the web application, with support for host and path-based routing.
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**: Automatically scales the number of pods based on CPU and memory usage or custom metrics.

## Getting Started

To use this Helm chart:

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[your-repo-name].git
```
2. Navigate to the chart directory:
```sh
cd [your-repo-name]/webapp
```
3. Install the chart into your Kubernetes cluster:
```sh
helm install my-webapp-release .
```
Make sure to review and adjust the values.yaml file according to your application's requirements.
## Customization
The chart is highly customizable. You can modify the values.yaml file to set application-specific configurations such as image repository, tag, resource requests and limits, environment variables, and more.
## Testing the Chart
Before deploying, you can validate and test the Helm chart using the helm template command:
```sh
helm template .
```
This command renders the templates locally without installing them, allowing you to verify their correctness.
